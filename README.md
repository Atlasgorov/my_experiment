# my_experiment
This repository contains my source codes of my paper's simulation and the results.

The "experiment_result" directory contains all results of the three algorithms mentioned in my paper on the three networks.

The "graph_preprocess" directory contains the original network datasets and the corresponding graph files after obtaining the community structure of the network. More information about each file in this directory is in the README.md file that is in the same directory.

The three python module :main_for_Epinions.py, main_for_Gnutella08.py and main_for_Wiki_Vote.py are the main functions to run on the three networks respectively.
